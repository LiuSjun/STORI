Code and Description of STORI model

![STORI](Flowchat.png)

- We present a novel  Spatio-Temporal Optical Reflectance Interpolation (STORI) method, which integrates Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and optical reflectance data to reconstruct continuous, high-density reflectance time series. The algorithm does not require any prior knowledge about the spatial distribution.

- STORI effectively fuses SAR and optical data, leveraging the complementary strengths of these modalities. SAR data, with its all-weather capability, fills the gaps in optical data, enabling the generation of cloud-free time series with high temporal resolution.

- The lightweight design of our model allows for efficient and accurate reconstruction without the need for additional training data, making it broadly applicable across various geographical and climatic regions..

**This code is ONLY released for academic use.**

## How to use
We split STORI into two components:

- rank-STORI
  - Framework: Pytorch
  - Training Resnet based Bi-LSTM network on source dataset
  - Learning to rank on target dataset
- STORI
  - Dependencies: Some traditional libraries, including numpy, pickle, matplotlib, seaborn
 Â - Building spatial temporal model with visual classification results
  - STORI Fusion

Written and tested in python2, Pytorch 1.12.4.

>Attention: make sure you are using the repos specified in STORI. You are possible to meet some errors if you use other version repos.
